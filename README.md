An Explorative Analysis on Microsoft Excel in this project and other tools like Pivot table and creating a Dashboard for Visualization purpose
## project Topic: Amazon Product Review Analysis
### Project overview
The primary objective of this dataset is to Analyze Amazon Product Performance, while focusing on how pricing strategies, discount percentages, and customer reviews can influence product visibility, customer trust and potential revenue.
By examining categories, discount buckets, rating volumes, and price segments, the goal is to;
- Uncover what drives sales success on the platform.
- Help sellers optimize their listings for maximum reach and revenue in a highly competitive value-driven marketplace.

### Data source
Order Data (CSV File) which contains a virtual shelf stacked with over 1,465 products. Where the data column headers were split into two tables on the same spreadsheet (Table 1 and Average) specifically.
 - Table 1 
   - product short name
   -   category
   -   price segments
   -   discount percentage
   -   reviews segments
  
-		Average
-	Average rating
-	Average discounted price
-	Product with discounts
-	Potential revenue
-	Bucket segments 
-	Rating segments

### Tools used
- MS Excel  [Download here](https://www.microsoft.com)
-	For data collection
-	For data cleaning

- 	Pivot Table
- 		Create a pivot table in conducting an analysis of the following findings
- 			Navigated between Table 1 and Average to source the necessary information for a complete analysis

- Dashboard
  - For further illustration of the analysis report given on the pivot table, a visualization insight was explored in the dashboard section using various chart type to demonstrate creativity.

### Data preparation
The data set was collected from excel which contained the data that required some amount of proper cleaning after which I commenced by merging and  inserting all column header in the separate tables  and proceeded to; 
-	Creating a pivot table
-	Analyze how pricing, discounting, and reviews impact product success on Amazon
-	Visualization illustration was achieved in the dashboard section.

### Exploratory Analysis Tasks
 This involved exploring of the data to answer some of the questions about the given dataset
•	What is the total number of reviews per category? (3.D Pie chart)
•	What is the average actual price Vs the discounted price by category? (Pie chart)
•	Which products have the highest number of reviews? (Clustered column 3.D)
•	What is the distribution of product ratings? (Line with Markers)
•	How does the rating relate to the level of discount? (Clustered Bar chart)
•	Which categories have products with the highest discounts? (3.D column)

## Review Volume by Product Category

INSERT NO 3
#### Insight: 
The Pivot Table reveals that certain product categories dominate in review volume, indicating higher customer engagement and possibly stronger sales performance.
-	Top-reviewed categories (e.g. Electronics, Computer &Accessories And Home & Kitchen) account for the majority of total reviews.
-	Categories like Heath & Personal Care, Toys & Games And Home Improvement Products may have fewer total reviews which suggest lower demand or niche from customers.
#### Interpretation
Categories with the most reviews tend to have greater visibility and buyer trust. These are likely priority areas for competitive analysis and promotional spend, 

## Category: Average Actual Price VS Discounted Price

INSERT NO 5
#### Insight
Discounts are a major sales strategy on Amazon.
-	Average discount percentage -60% (Most products were reviewed to be sold far below their actual price).
-	Over 40% of the products had a discount of ≥ 50%, flagged clearly in the column Product with discount ≥50%.
#### Interpretation
This is not a coincident that Amazon and its sellers rely heavily on customer perceived value. With cutting down their prices dramatically, they gain access into psychology of the buyers hence triggering FOMO and urgency

## Rating Realities

INSERT 6 & 8
#### Insight
Ratings offer social proof. But here’s what stands out:
•	The Average rating is 4.0- 4.2, but some products records thousands of rating boosting their visibility.
•	The column Top 5 by Rating and Review combines rating and review count for a composite value.
#### Interpretation
 It’s not just about having a high rating. A product with 4.0 and 10,000 reviews beats a product with 4.9 and 50 reviews in visibility. 

## The Relationship between Rating and Discount

INSERT NO 11
#### Insight
Often times we assume that the higher-rated products with full-price are “worth it,” but the data suggests a more. 
Here is what was discovered:
-	Many highly rated products with (4.5+) still offer significant discounts (20–40%).
-	However, extreme discounts (50% or more) are more common among moderately rated products (3.5–4.2).
- 	Products with both a high rating and a high review volume rarely have the biggest discounts, because they already rank well organically.
#### Interpretation:
Discounting may be used as a strategic lift for:
-	Boosting visibility of mid-rated products (not bad, not excellent).
-	Clearing stock or staying competitive in crowded categories
-	Improving social proof: more buyers = more reviews = algorithm boost.

## Categories with the Highest Average Discounts

INSERT NO 13
#### Insight
The data shows that Home Improvement, Computer &Accessories And Health & Personal Care are the top three categories offering the highest average discounts, with Home Improvement leading at 57.50%
These deep discounts suggest:
-	Highly competitive markets where prices are lowered to gain visibility and increase conversion rate.
-	Possible strategies to clear stock, attract new customers, or boost product rankings.
  #### Interpretation
High discount does not equate to low value. In categories like Home Improvement and Computer & Accessories, discount percentage pricing is a strategy, not just a clearance tactic. These segments likely rely on volume, competition, and promotional cycles to drive sales.
-	Consumers who shop in these categories may be more price-sensitive or are driven by deal-hunting behavior.
