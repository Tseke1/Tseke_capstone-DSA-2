An Explorative Analysis on Microsoft Excel in this project and other tools like Pivot table and creating a Dashboard for Visualization purpose
## project Topic: Amazon Product Review Analysis
### Project overview
The primary objective of this dataset is to Analyze Amazon Product Performance, while focusing on how pricing strategies, discount percentages, and customer reviews can influence product visibility, customer trust and potential revenue.
By examining categories, discount buckets, rating volumes, and price segments, the goal is to;
- Uncover what drives sales success on the platform.
- Help sellers optimize their listings for maximum reach and revenue in a highly competitive value-driven marketplace.

### Data source
Order Data (CSV File) which contains a virtual shelf stacked with over 1,465 products. Where the data column headers were split into two tables on the same spreadsheet (Table 1 and Average) specifically.
 - Table 1 
   - product short name
   -   category
   -   price segments
   -   discount percentage
   -   reviews segments
  
-		Average
-	Average rating
-	Average discounted price
-	Product with discounts
-	Potential revenue
-	Bucket segments 
-	Rating segments

### Tools used
- MS Excel  [Download here](https://www.microsoft.com)
-	For data collection
-	For data cleaning

- 	Pivot Table
- 		Create a pivot table in conducting an analysis of the following findings
- 			Navigated between Table 1 and Average to source the necessary information for a complete analysis

- Dashboard
  - For further illustration of the analysis report given on the pivot table, a visualization insight was explored in the dashboard section using various chart type to demonstrate creativity.

### Data preparation
The data set was collected from excel which contained the data that required some amount of proper cleaning after which I commenced by merging and  inserting all column header in the separate tables  and proceeded to; 
-	Creating a pivot table
-	Analyze how pricing, discounting, and reviews impact product success on Amazon
-	Visualization illustration was achieved in the dashboard section.

### Exploratory Analysis Tasks
 This involved exploring of the data to answer some of the questions about the given dataset
•	What is the total number of reviews per category? (3.D Pie chart)
•	What is the average actual price Vs the discounted price by category? (Pie chart)
•	Which products have the highest number of reviews? (Clustered column 3.D)
•	What is the distribution of product ratings? (Line with Markers)
•	How does the rating relate to the level of discount? (Clustered Bar chart)
•	Which categories have products with the highest discounts? (3.D column)

## Review Volume by Product Category


#### Insight: 
The Pivot Table reveals that certain product categories dominate in review volume, indicating higher customer engagement and possibly stronger sales performance.
-	Top-reviewed categories (e.g. Electronics, Computer &Accessories And Home & Kitchen) account for the majority of total reviews.
-	Categories like Heath & Personal Care, Toys & Games And Home Improvement Products may have fewer total reviews which suggest lower demand or niche from customers.
#### Interpretation
Categories with the most reviews tend to have greater visibility and buyer trust. These are likely priority areas for competitive analysis and promotional spend,
